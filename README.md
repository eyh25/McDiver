# McDiver
In this completed project, McDiver explores the London Sewer System to find a hidden ring. Equipped with a distance detector, he locates the ring but triggers a trap that takes him to a lower level filled with valuable treasures. McDiver must collect treasure while finding the exit within a limited number of steps, all while avoiding toxic fumes. The project offers an exciting game-like experience, combining navigation, treasure collection, and timely escape. Players enjoy the challenge of uncovering treasures while strategically navigating the tunnels to avoid the fumes and complete the mission.
